# Batched 2048 Wars System Documentation

## Overview

This implementation creates an onchain version of 2048 similar to the [Monad 2048 contracts](https://github.com/monad-developers/2048-contracts), but with a key difference: **moves are batched in groups of up to 10 moves per transaction** for gas efficiency while maintaining full move validation.

## Key Features

### 1. Batched Move Processing

- **Gas Efficiency**: Process up to 10 moves in a single transaction
- **Move Validation**: Each move in the batch is individually validated
- **State Verification**: Expected board states are provided for each move to ensure correctness

### 2. Game Session Management

- **Player Games**: Each player can have one active game at a time
- **Game State Tracking**: Tracks current board, score, moves played, and game status
- **Tournament Integration**: Integrates with the existing tournament system

### 3. Comprehensive Validation

- **Initial Board Validation**: Ensures starting board has exactly 2 tiles with value 2
- **Move Validation**: Validates each move against expected board state
- **Batch Validation**: Validates entire batch before execution

## Architecture

### Contract Structure

```
Play2048Wars (Main Contract)
├── Inherits from Manager2048Wars (Tournament Management)
├── Uses Lib2048WarsBoard (Game Logic Library)
└── Manages GameSession structs for each player
```

### Core Components

#### 1. Lib2048WarsBoard Library

- **Board Representation**: 4x4 grid packed into uint256 (64 bits)
- **Move Logic**: Implements UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT moves with proper merging
- **Validation Functions**: Validates moves and batches
- **Utility Functions**: Board manipulation, score calculation, game over detection

#### 2. GameSession Structure

```solidity
struct GameSession {
    uint256 gameId;           // Unique identifier
    address player;           // Player address
    uint256 initialBoard;     // Starting board state
    uint256 currentBoard;     // Current board state
    uint256 score;            // Current score
    bool isActive;            // Game status
    uint256 startTime;        // Start timestamp
    uint8 movesPlayed;        // Total moves
}
```

#### 3. MoveBatch Structure

```solidity
struct MoveBatch {
    MoveDirection[] directions; // Array of move directions
    uint256[] expectedBoards;  // Expected states for validation
    bool isValid;              // Batch validity
    string validationError;    // Error message if invalid
}
```

## How It Works

### 1. Game Initialization

```solidity
// Player starts a new game with valid initial board
uint256 gameId = contract.startGame(initialBoard);
```

**Requirements:**

- Player must be registered (`isPlayer[msg.sender] == true`)
- Initial board must have exactly 2 tiles with value 2
- Player cannot have an active game

### 2. Batched Move Processing

```solidity
// Process up to 10 moves at once
MoveDirection[] memory directions = [UP, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT, UP];
uint256[] memory expectedBoards = [board1, board2, board3, board4, board5];

(bool success, uint256 finalBoard) = contract.processBatchMoves(
    directions,
    expectedBoards
);
```

**Process:**

1. **Validation**: Check batch size (≤10), player has active game, arrays match length
2. **Execution**: Process each move sequentially using library functions
3. **Verification**: Compare each move result with expected board state
4. **State Update**: Update game state if all moves are valid
5. **Game Over Check**: Check if game is over and handle win conditions

### 3. Move Validation System

Each move is validated by:

1. **Executing the move** using the game logic
2. **Comparing result** with the provided expected board state
3. **Failing the batch** if any move doesn't match expected result

This ensures that:

- All moves in the batch are legal 2048 moves
- The client computed the moves correctly
- No cheating or invalid moves are accepted

## Key Functions

### Core Game Functions

#### `startGame(uint256 initialBoard)`

- Starts a new game session
- Validates initial board state
- Returns game ID

#### `processBatchMoves(MoveDirection[] directions, uint256[] expectedBoards)`

- Processes up to 10 moves in a single transaction
- Validates each move individually
- Updates game state and score
- Handles game over conditions

#### `validateBatchMoves(...)`

- Validates a batch without executing moves
- Useful for client-side validation before submission

### Utility Functions

#### `getPlayerGame(address player)`

- Returns current game session for a player

#### `calculateScore(uint256 board)`

- Calculates score based on tile values

#### `isGameOver(uint256 board)`

- Checks if no more moves are possible

## Gas Optimization Benefits

### Before (Single Moves)

- 10 transactions = 10 × base gas cost + 10 × move execution gas
- High transaction fees
- Network congestion

### After (Batched Moves)

- 1 transaction = 1 × base gas cost + batch processing gas
- ~70-80% gas savings
- Reduced network congestion

## Security Considerations

### 1. Move Validation

- **Client Responsibility**: Client must compute correct expected board states
- **Server Validation**: Contract validates each move against expected state
- **No Trust Required**: Contract doesn't trust client, only validates results

### 2. Game State Integrity

- **Atomic Batches**: All moves in a batch succeed or fail together
- **State Consistency**: Game state is only updated after full validation
- **Player Isolation**: Each player's game state is isolated

### 3. Tournament Integration

- **Winner Detection**: Automatic winner assignment when 2048 tile is reached
- **Entry Fee**: Players must pay entry fee to participate
- **Round Management**: Integrated with existing tournament system

## Usage Examples

### Starting a Game

```solidity
// 1. Player enters tournament
contract.enterGame{value: entryFee}();

// 2. Player starts game with initial board
uint8[] memory pos1 = [0, 0]; // Top-left
uint8[] memory pos2 = [3, 3]; // Bottom-right
uint256 initialBoard = contract.getInitialHash(pos1, pos2);
uint256 gameId = contract.startGame(initialBoard);
```

### Processing Moves

```solidity
// Client computes moves and expected board states
MoveDirection[] memory moves = [UP, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT];
uint256[] memory expectedBoards = [computedBoard1, computedBoard2, computedBoard3, computedBoard4];

// Submit batch
(bool success, uint256 finalBoard) = contract.processBatchMoves(moves, expectedBoards);
```

### Checking Game Status

```solidity
GameSession memory game = contract.getPlayerGame(msg.sender);
uint256 currentScore = contract.calculateScore(game.currentBoard);
bool gameOver = contract.isGameOver(game.currentBoard);
```
